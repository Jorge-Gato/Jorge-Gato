# Hi there 👋🏽
<p>My name is Jorge. I was born to Cuban parents in sunny south Florida in the early 80's. 1st generation American. I remember as a very young kid my neighbor invited me over to his house to check out the new computer his parents just bought and was blown away when he started showing me very pixely photos of girls in bikinis. Then my head almost exploded when he started playing this super scary game called doom! I've been hooked ever since.</p><p> After high school at the age of 17 I enlisted in the United States Navy where I trained to be a Cryptologic Technician in Communications or a "CTO" where I graduated at top of my class. I got orders to Italy and spent the majority of my enlistment there where I worked as part of a group in a 24/7, 365 days/year manned underground top secret facility that were in charge of providing our deployed vessels sailors/soldiers with secure and reliable communications in Med/IO using various methods and encryption techniques.</p><p><!--Testing out putting a comment in the text -->After my enlistment was up I decided to take the money I had saved up over the last few years and just take a break. Moved to the Florida keys to be closer to my parents and live the island lifestyle up a bit. That didn't last too long before I was bored to tears and was back in the IT wheelhouse where I felt is where I've always belonged. I've been kicking the tires and lighting the fires ever since. Going to school, getting certifications and gaining real life experience learning about the IT side of things from a civillian/non military presepective. I have a heavy networking background but have recently started diving into the world of programming, development, and cloud computing. Someone I know who has helped motivate me to pursue my interests in programming told me that setting up a github and a linkedin was a thing to do, so here I am. I'm dipping my toes in the pool before I jump all in! I'm excited to challenge myself and see how creative I can get with this so let's GO!</p><br>

Really interesting. Here is 2 different re-writes that AI came up with from my last paragraph.

Re-write 1:

Post my military service, I chose to utilize my savings for a well-deserved break. I relocated to the Florida Keys to be near my family and experience the island life. However, the idyllic lifestyle soon lost its charm, and I found myself drawn back to the IT field, where I felt most at home. Since then, I’ve been actively involved in learning and growing in the IT sector, acquiring certifications, and gaining practical experience from a civilian perspective. My expertise lies in networking, but I’ve recently ventured into programming, development, and cloud computing. A friend who inspired me to explore programming suggested setting up a GitHub and LinkedIn account, and here I am, ready to dive in! I’m eager to push my boundaries and unleash my creativity in this new journey. Let’s get started!

Re-write 2:

Once my military tenure ended, I decided to use my accumulated savings to take a breather. I moved to the Florida Keys to be in proximity to my parents and soak in the island lifestyle. But the monotony soon set in, and I found myself returning to the IT domain, which I’ve always considered my true calling. Ever since, I’ve been on a continuous learning curve, pursuing education, earning certifications, and gaining hands-on experience in IT from a non-military standpoint. While my primary background is in networking, I’ve recently begun exploring programming, development, and cloud computing. Encouraged by an acquaintance who motivated me to delve into programming, I set up a GitHub and LinkedIn account. Now, I’m just testing the waters before I fully immerse myself. I’m thrilled to take on this challenge and see how inventive I can be. Let’s dive in!
